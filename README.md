## Calculations

### Reward

#### Reward is decided by staking amount and staking duration, and user must do at least one tx on furucombo.gst
* `staking_amount` - the amount of token in a staking contract, e.g., user A/B/C stakes `50/30/20` COMBO in the staking contract
* `staking_duration` - the duration of token in a staking contract, e.g., user A/B/C's staking duration is `46500` blocks ~= 1 week.
* Eligibility requirement: send out at least one transaction on Furucombo during each weekâ€™s program.
* Note that this script tracks the staking amount and duration every block, so higher staking amount for longer duration gives higher reward.

#### Let `staking_area = staking_amount * staking_duration`
* A/B/C's `staking_area` are `2,325,000/1,395,000/930,000`
* A/B/C's `weight` = `50%/30%/20%` by normalizing `staking_area` into [0, 1]

#### Therefore, the reward distribution of 46,875 COMBO for a staking pool
* A/B/C's `reward` = `23437.5/14062.5/9,375` COMBO

### What's the difference between COMBO and COMBO/ETH LP pool?
* COMBO Pool
  * Rewards: 46,875 COMBO
  * Competition rule: base amount = 250 COMBO
  * Every traded user, no matter if they stake or not, will share the rewards in this pool. If you have made trades but staked 0 COMBO, we will automatically act as if staked 250 COMBO when calculating the rewards; if you have made trades and have staked 1000 COMBO, we will act as if you have staked 1250 COMBO when calculating the rewards.
* COMBO/ETH Uniswap V2 Liquidity Pool
  * Rewards: 140,625 COMBO
  * Only people who stake LP tokens will be able to share the rewards in this pool.
